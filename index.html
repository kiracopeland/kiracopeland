                    </h2>
                    <p>My name is Kira Copeland, a Front-End web designer from Canberra. I'm currently working towards the completion of my Bachelor of Web Design and Production from the University of Canberra.
                    </p>
                    <p>I simply love designing and working on the Web, aiming to create works that are modern, flexible, and elegant. I'm always up for a challenge, and I love figuring out the best solution for any given project.

                        <h3>Experience</h3>
                        <p>I have been working with the Web for 7 years now, using languages such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, AJAX and PHP just to name a few. My perferred applications of choice are Adobe Creative Suite, as well as libraies and frameworks such as React, Bootstrap, etc.</p>

                        <h3>Creativity</h3>
                        <p>I pride myself on being able to create designs that are rich in both visual design and functionality. I'm a firm believer that everything should look as beautifully as it performs.</p>

                        <h3>Enthusiasm</h3>
                        <p>I've known I wanted to be a web developer ever since I changed the background colour of a website when I was 12. Since then, I've been challenging myself to be as productive and resourceful as possible when it comes to the web, and it's technologies.</p>

                        <h3>Attention to Detail</h3>
                        <p>I believe attentiveness is one of the most important aspects to have as a developer and designer, as it allow us to find innovative and artistic solutions. Attention to one's self is also important to allow efficient communication and preparation.</p>
